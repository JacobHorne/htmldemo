			<h1>All Spiced Up</h1>
				<p>	Outlander Spices opened its doors in 1989 and has since become one of the largest spice companies in the world. We provide the highest quality spices from all over the world and select gourmet foods. We serve restaurants and retailers throughout the USA and Europe. We are one of the first spice companies to have our own Web site. Customers from various corners of the world can now purchase our products directly via the Internet. We have  twenty kiosk locations within gourmet grocery stores in the West. There are plans to expand the kiosk operations into stores on the East and the Midwest over the next two years.
				</p>
			
				<p>Outlander Spices currently has 40 employees. 30 of them are based in the home location, Portland, Oregon, and there are 10 remote sales people based in 4 regions (East, South, West, North). The company has five divisions with a VP in charge of each division.
				</p>
			
				<p>The buyers at Outlander Spice pride themselves in locating premium "pure vegetarian" products. Nearly every one of our spice blends is vegetarian. These spices will enhance any vegetarian meal, because the ingredients are fresh and blended in small batches.
				</p> 

				<p>All products listed in our vegetarian section are guaranteed not to contain any meat or meat byproducts.

			<h2>About our spices</h2>
				<p>For years we've been involved in food service and manufacturing where the finished product must be consistent week in and week out. All major food manufacturers buy their spices from premier importers. So do we!! Every Outlander spice is of premium quality. Outlander spices not only excel in quality, flavor, and freshness but also are priced much lower than spices in retail stores.

				<p>We are also planning to launch a dedicated spice market on the Web. This spice market will help us cater to the increasing demand for our spices from various parts of the world. Buyers will be able to place orders easily on the Web site. They can select from our vast range of spices, spice blends, and other products and the premium products will be delivered to their doorsteps.
